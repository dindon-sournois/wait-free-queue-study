Memory reclamation is not easy because of ABA problem

memory reclemation for system without garbage collector

malloc is not non-blocking, own allocation mechanism or we allocate a pool of

cleanup retired segments
update tail and head pointers
visit threads in reserve order
overhead ?
thread failure ?
