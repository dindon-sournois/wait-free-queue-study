fastest wait-free is slower than the fastest lock-free

lock-free:
 - MS-Queue : CAS failures (with a reasonable number of threads)

wait-free:
- based on MS-Queue: overhead of helping mechanism
- P-Sim, use Fetch and Add too

blocking:
- CC-queue: combining

lock-free:
- LCRQ: circular ring queue with Fetch and Add to get index, enqueue and dequeue
with double width compare and swap, which is not always available

fast-path slow-path â†’ with MS-queue as fast path

Compare and swap problem: unbounded operation


CAS retry problem : heavy contention = high probability of CAS failures, low
scalability even with a low number of threads, use of fetch and add to get a
free cell can solve this problem
