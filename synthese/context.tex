\para{MS-queue} The MS-queue \cite{Michael96simple} from is a classical simple
lock-free queue implemented with only compare-and-swap as primitive. As a
consequence, it is subject to the compare-and-swap retry problem. Even with a
low number of threads, performance are drastically reduced under contention
because of high probability of compare-and-swap failures.

MS-queue avoids the ABA problem by using double width compare-and-swap. Each
compare-and-swap to an address also increments a counter associated with that
address so that the comparison is done with one address and an integer
\cite{Herlihy08} \cite{Michael96simple}. \\

\para{Practical wait-free queue} One of the first implementation of a wait-free
queue with multiples enqueuers and dequeuers was designed . based on MS-Queue:
overhead of helping mechanism \\

\para{P-Sim queue} wait-free universal construction \\

\para{CC-queue} blocking, better performance, combining \\

\para{LCRQ} lock-free circular ring queue with Fetch and Add to get index, enqueue and
dequeue with double width compare and swap, which is not always available \\

\para{Fast-path slow-path} â†’ with MS-queue as fast path
