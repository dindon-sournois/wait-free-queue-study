C. Yang and J. Mellor-Crummey designed a wait-free queue from a simple
obstruction-free queue using the fast-path-slow-path methodology. They provide
the first wait-free queue with performance comparable to prior lock-free and
blocking designs, which make it usable on most multi-core architecture and for
most applications. Their also implemented a memory reclamation mechanism without
any overhead on x86 architecture, unlike previous works.

However, they significantly increased the design complexity. In the case where
one application can neglect the low probability of the worse-case scenario
(slow-path), using a lock-free or obstruction-free algorithm may be an
acceptable solution because of a simpler implementation.
