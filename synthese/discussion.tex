experimental results show that 99.9\% enqueue don't go slow, and at most 96\%
don't go slow path

Fetch and Add can fails (at hardware level)

memory reclamation scheme proned to thread failures (unbounded memory leakage)
DEBRA thread failure for memory reclamation

FAA slower than LCRQ

not clear if they tested the fast-path-slow-path methodology with MS-queue as
fast path, it would seem the be the best wait-free implementation queue at that
time

they use a ? to get rid of inconsistent experimental results, however for real
applications, thos inconsistences do exist

they added memory reclamation system

adding works to avoid long run scenarios (low cache miss) -> imporves perf on
Haswell ?
